# ABSTRACT 
In present, vehicular traffic is increasing throughout the world, especially in large urban areas. The number of road user's increase constantly and current resources & infrastructures are limited. These needs have led to highly increasing demand for an ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù traffic control system. Our project will demonstrate the optimization of traffic lights or ‚Äòsmart signals‚Äô in a city using wireless sensors. Traffic light optimization is a tough problem as the state of one light node influences the flow of traffic towards many other nodes. We proposed a traffic light controller that allows us to control and study different situations of traffic density. We sense the density of traffic using infrared sensors. Our system can detect emergency situations and act according to the priority of the vehicle. It can also detect stalled vehicles using special algorithms and can help the owner with roadside assistance. The optimization of signal timings across the junctions saves fuel consumption exponentially. As per TOI, with approximately 55,000 new cars added on road yearly the fuel consumption nearly drops down by ‚Çπ5.5m. With implementation of Intel IOT in this concept the scope of this project can be further enhanced to add new features to the design.
